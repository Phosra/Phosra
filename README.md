Should you really need to contact me: https://t.me/Phosra, unless you've already met me on another platform, in which case message me there.

You can find me optimising software, complaining about compilers, or doing anything involving WebAssembly.

I'm familiar with C++, Rust, WebAssembly, and Arm(v7/v8), among other programming languages and technologies.

I <3 playing with bitwise operations, SWAR, SIMD, DOD, mathematics, and optimising for performance.

Unemployed; available for contract & remote work.
