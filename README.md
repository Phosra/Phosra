Should you really need to contact me: https://t.me/Phosra, unless you've already met me on another platform, in which case message me there.

You can find me optimizing software, complaining about compilers, or doing anything involving WebAssembly.

I'm familiar with C++, Rust, Arm(v7), and Wasm, among other programming languages and technologies.

Skilled with bitwise operations, SWAR, and SIMD.

Avaliable for contract & remote work.
