People shouldn't need to write weird hacks in order to achieve performance - that's what compilers are for!
I'm hoping that we can make them even better than they already are, so that systems development languages can emit ever so slightly better code generation.

I'm familiar with C++ and Rust, among other languages and technologies.

Should you really need to contact me: https://t.me/Phosra, unless you've already met me on another platform, in which case, message me there.
